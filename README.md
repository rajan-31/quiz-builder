# Quiz Builder

### Goals

- ~~allow authenticated users to create their own quizzes~~

- ~~anonymous visitors to take quiz and see how many questions they got right~~
- ~~register and sign in using email and password.~~
- ~~traditional login form, or use services such as Auth0 or Firebase Authentication (or any similar service)~~

\
\

- ~~Once a user signs in, they should be able to create a quiz~~
- ~~every quiz has a title and consists of 1-10 questions~~
- ~~Every question has 1-5 possible answer~~
    - ~~check this in api max 5 min 1~~
- ~~single correct answer, or a question where the visitor is expected to select all correct answers~~


\
\

-  ~~published quiz should have a __permalink__, a randomly generated sequence of __6 alphanumeric__ characters~~
- ~~People taking the quiz by following the permalink do not have to be authenticated~~
- ~~"You answered 5/8 questions correctly"~~
- ~~You are not required to record the visitor’s answers or test results~~

\
\

- ~~Every user only has access to their own list of quizzes~~
- ~~__Visitors should be aware of that MCQ and MSQ questions__~~
-  ~~Published quizzes can’t be edited anymore by the author, __only deleted__~~.

\
\

- ~~Application needs to have client and server components use NUXT js.~~
- ~~server component needs to expose a GraphQL or RESTful API. ~~
- ~~he client application needs to be a single-page application~~
- ~~fully server-side rendered fragment frameworks such as Turbolinks/Hotwire and similar is NOT acceptable~~
- ~~The API should not be coupled with the front-end application~~
- ~~if somebody wanted to build a different UI (eg. a mobile app) for the service - they should be able to do so without the server code being modified~~

\
\

- Be mindful of the edge cases and unexpected scenarios.
- Be mindful of security and data validation
